# VK Music Player

A music player for vk.com

This player is currently not working due to vk.com disabling the whole music API.

Main things I've done in this project:
1. Created a WPF interface of an app from scratch,
2. Practiced  
2.1 Saving/opening non-txt files,  
2.2 HTTP requests to API of an external site,  
2.3 Working with external libraries (bass.dll)
